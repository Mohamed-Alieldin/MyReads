# MyReads Project

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course which is a part of Udacity React Nano Degree Program. The starter goal was to save time by providing a static example of the CSS and HTML markup that may be used, but without any of the React code that is needed to complete the project.
This project only includes the requirments for the project to be accepted.

## Installation

To get started:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Description
The Application consists of two pages, main page and search page. The main page contain the books selected by the user. Each categorized by one of the categories read, want to read, and currently reading.
The search page allows the user to search books using a backend api provided by Udacity to allow the user to select any book to add it to any category.

## Important About The Search Feature
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
